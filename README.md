# **Library Game Design**

This is a collaboration project between Developer's Club and the Library. The Developer's Club members are using their programming skills to make a game that teaches primary students (ages 5–8) the rules of the library through play.

##  **Project Goals**

  - Teach core library rules in a kid-friendly, non-punitive way
  - Create an accessible 2D game playable on desktop and tablets
  - Use bright, soft visuals and simple interactions to engage young children
  - Provide educators and librarians with an interactive learning aid

##  **Key features**

  - Level-based library zones with increasing challenges
  - Player movement, pickup/drop interactions, and collision detection
  - NPCs that guide scenarios and ask for help
  - Educational pop-ups and short mini-quizzes with positive feedback
  - Large, accessible UI (big buttons, no time limits)
  - Rewards: stars, stickers, and “Librarian Badges” with celebratory animations

## **Group work & responsibilities**
Group 1 — Art, Assets & Environment Design
  
  - Create 2D sprites: player avatars, NPCs, books, shelves, carts.
  - Background art for library zones (fiction/non-fiction, entrance).
  - Animate sprite actions (walking, picking up books) using CSS or sprite sheets.
  - Visual style: bright soft colors, rounded shapes.
  - Save assets in web-friendly formats (PNG, SVG) and organize in /assets.

Group 2 — Core Gameplay Mechanics
  
  - Build the play area using HTML5 Canvas or vanilla JS.
  - Implement player controls (left/right, jump), keyboard + on-screen buttons.
  - Collision detection for shelves/walls/objects.
  - Pickup/drop mechanics; enforce correct shelf placement.
  - Create 3–5 levels (library zones) with progressive learning goals.

Group 3 — Educational Content & Interactions
  
  - Design scenario-based learning moments tied to library rules.
  - Create NPC requests and consequence-free mistakes.
  - Implement short, visual mini-quizzes with immediate positive feedback.
  - Use simple language suitable for ages 5–8.
  - Prioritize and map in-game moments to learning goals.

Group 4 — UI, Feedback & Accessibility

  - Create start screen, level select, in-game prompts, end-of-level screens.
  - Large, easy-to-tap buttons and high-contrast visuals.
  - Reward systems (stars, badges), confetti or small celebrations.
  - Ensure no strict time limits; test and refine UI flow.
