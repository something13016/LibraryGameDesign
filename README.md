# **Library Game Design**

This is a collaboration project between Developer's Club and the Library. The Developer's Club members are using their programming skills to make a game that teaches primary students (ages 5–8) the rules of the library through play.

##  **Project Goals**

  - Teach core library rules in a kid-friendly, non-punitive way
  - Create an accessible 2D game playable on desktop and tablets
  - Use bright, soft visuals and simple interactions to engage young children
  - Provide educators and librarians with an interactive learning aid

##  **Key features**

  - Level-based library zones with increasing challenges
  - Player movement, pickup/drop interactions, and collision detection
  - NPCs that guide scenarios and ask for help
  - Educational pop-ups and short mini-quizzes with positive feedback
  - Large, accessible UI (big buttons, no time limits)
  - Rewards: stars, stickers, and “Librarian Badges” with celebratory animations

## **Group work & responsibilities**
Group 1 — Art, Assets & Environment Design
  
  - Create 2D sprites: player avatars, NPCs, books, shelves, carts.
  - Background art for library zones (fiction/non-fiction, entrance).
  - Animate sprite actions (walking, picking up books) using CSS or sprite sheets.
  - Visual style: bright soft colors, rounded shapes.
  - Save assets in web-friendly formats (PNG, SVG) and organize in /assets.

Group 2 — Core Gameplay Mechanics
  
  - Build the play area using HTML5 Canvas or vanilla JS.
  - Implement player controls (left/right, jump), keyboard + on-screen buttons.
  - Collision detection for shelves/walls/objects.
  - Pickup/drop mechanics; enforce correct shelf placement.
  - Create 3–5 levels (library zones) with progressive learning goals.

Group 3 — Educational Content & Interactions
  
  - Design scenario-based learning moments tied to library rules.
  - Create NPC requests and consequence-free mistakes.
  - Implement short, visual mini-quizzes with immediate positive feedback.
  - Use simple language suitable for ages 5–8.
  - Prioritize and map in-game moments to learning goals.

Group 4 — UI, Feedback & Accessibility

  - Create start screen, level select, in-game prompts, end-of-level screens.
  - Large, easy-to-tap buttons and high-contrast visuals.
  - Reward systems (stars, badges), confetti or small celebrations.
  - Ensure no strict time limits; test and refine UI flow.

## **Library Rules**

## Before entering the library for library classes
  - Lower voice to level 0 or 1 upon arrival at the library entrance hallway area.
  - Put backpacks, food, and drinks inside the cubbies. When cubbies are full, keep them neatly along the wall.
  - Return library books in the green box (or the minion box when the library is closed). Place books gently, do not drop or slam.
  - Silently line up in two straight lines. Keep hands at your sides. Do not play with ID cards.
  - Use hand sanitizer to clean your hands. Remember to say “Thank you” and nobody is allowed to play with hand sanitizer.
  - Walk into the library with voice level 0.

## During library lecture time
  - Follow directions and stay in the designated area.
  - Keep your hands and feet to yourselves.
  - Listen carefully to librarians and do not play with ID cards.
  - Raise your hands before asking questions.

## During free reading time
  - Always use shelf markers to take books out of bookshelves and send books back to the right bookshelves.
  - Take only one book each time.
  - Don’t fight for books with classmates.
  - Take turns to use the OPAC machines for searching library books.
  - Sit in the designated areas for silent reading.
  - Talk about books in whisper voice.
  - Do not run or play hide-and-seek games in the library.

## When checking out library books
  - Do not cover face, name, or student number on the school ID card with stickers.
  - Inspect the book’s physical condition before checking it out.
  - Line up quietly and patiently at the Help Desk for your turn.
  - Show your respect to librarians by saying “May I borrow a book, please?” and “Thank you for your help.”
  - Each student can check out 5 books for 4 weeks.
  - Do not use your school ID card to check out books for others.

## Before leaving the library
  - Return your shelf-marker to the right place.
  - Tidy up the table and push back the chair.
  - Throw trash into the trash can.
  - Library helpers should count the total number of shelf-markers and report any missing shelf-markers to the librarians.
  - Library helpers fold the sashes and hand them in to the librarians.
  - Line up quietly in two straight lines, hold the checked out library books in front of your chest and say goodbye to librarians in whisper voice.
  - Use the “Zipper Merge” way to pass the security door.
  - Return to the Help Desk with your library books upon triggering the security door alarm.

## When checking in library books
  - Return library books before the due date.
  - Report lost or damaged library books on time.
